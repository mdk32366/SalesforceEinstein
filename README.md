#### Einstein Analytics
Finally, I was overwhelmed with how many good sessions there were on Einstein—the artificial intelligence app for Salesforce—and I tried to attend as many as I could. The more I learned, the more I realized that Einstein truly does have applications in any part of a Salesforce org. Here are two key takeaways that I’m excited about:

##### 1. Einstein Platform

While Einstein Analytics was previously powerful, it was limited in that it could mostly act on standard Salesforce objects, even though 80% of customer data resides in custom objects. Einstein Platform allows us to use Einstein Analytics to build predictions and discover trends on data stored in custom objects. Prediction Builder, an app in the Einstein Platform, allows you to easily create and train a model that can begin to drive business decisions. It provides a score so you know how accurate your model is, and shows how changes in key metrics will affect outcomes. With Einstein Discovery, you have the ability to analyze data across multiple dimensions, and paired with Einstein Stories, you can run data analysis over every permutation across every dimension. Again, the name of the game is simplicity, as the platform provides easy-to-use declarative tools to create, train, and use these models.

##### 2. Einstein Voice

During the main keynote, Marc Benioff revealed Salesforce’s response to Siri and Alexa: Einstein Voice. This smart assistant is more than just a speech-to-text helper: it can update data, drive Salesforce functionality, and even provide voice technology to Einstein Bots. Using natural language processing, Einstein Voice is able to analyze a voice memo—say, after a meeting—and create actionable items or update records. The following video shows Einstein Voice in action:
